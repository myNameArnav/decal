# Decal 

[Website](https://mynamearnav.github.io/decal/)

The inspiration for making this came from this [tweet](https://twitter.com/myNameArnav/status/1741061855265616211).

Basically it takes the month number (January = 1, February = 2...) and divides it by the date, so for Jan 15 we get `1/15 = 0.0667`
